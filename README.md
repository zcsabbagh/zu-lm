## Current Development Focus: Transcript Generation Quality

### Priority Issue
We are currently experiencing suboptimal transcript generation quality due to prompt engineering issues. This needs to be addressed as a priority item to improve the overall user experience.

### To Do
- [ ] Review and revise current prompt engineering for transcript generation
- [ ] Test different prompt variations to improve output quality
- [ ] Implement and validate prompt improvements
- [ ] Document successful prompt patterns

### Contributing
If you're working on transcript generation improvements, please:
1. Document your prompt variations and their results
2. Include examples of both successful and unsuccessful outputs
3. Consider edge cases in different conversation contexts

We welcome contributions and suggestions for improving the transcript generation quality.
